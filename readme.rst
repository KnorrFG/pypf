PyPF

.. _Datasheet: https://datasheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

PyPF is a python library that contains functions that make it easy to create a 
Pathfinder character sheet in python in combination with my `Datasheet`_
library.

There is no real documentation but you can checkout 
`my blog post <https://knorrfg.github.io/programming/2019/08/25/pypf.html>`_ 
about it, which basically covers everything.
